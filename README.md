# Safer Polymorphing

Improves the polymorph experience by making it so your allies and homing projectiles won't betray you, probably.

This works by making a new faction and filling its relations stats with the best of Player and the polymorph target. This means you won't lose the friendliness from your allies, rats (plage rats perk), or your polymorph target faction. It doesn't mean those things can't hurt you.

Untested in multiplayer but it'll probably work fine.
